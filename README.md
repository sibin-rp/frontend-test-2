- Clone this repository. 
- Divide your task to small piece/task and assigne.
- Familier with `conflicts`, `merge`, `rebase`, `stash`, `stash apply`
- Once it complete, create a `Release`
- We will use Heroku as `staging` and `production`
- Master is your complete main branch, Production is your current stable, Staging used to show progress
