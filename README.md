Team test for frontend interns 

### Test to learn HTML,CSS and Jquery 

We need to convert a Template to a working website. We may use Rails or anyother framework as backend. 
We will have forms, validations, sliders. 

#### We should use 
- SSH 
- HAML
- SASS
- Javascript plugins   


#### How this work

- Clone this repository. 
- Divide your task to small piece/task and assigne.
- Familier with `conflicts`, `merge`, `rebase`, `stash`, `stash apply`
- Once it complete, create a `Release`
- We will use Heroku as `staging` and `production`
- Master is your complete main branch, Production is your current stable, Staging used to show progress
